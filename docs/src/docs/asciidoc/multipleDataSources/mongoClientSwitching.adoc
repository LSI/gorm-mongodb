You can switch to a different connection at runtime with the `withConnection` method:

[source,groovy]
----
Book.withConnection("moreBooks") {
    Book.list()
}
----

Any logic executed within the body of the closure will use the alternate connection. Once the close finishes execution GORM will switch back to the default connection automatically.
