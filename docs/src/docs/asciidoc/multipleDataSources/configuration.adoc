To configure multiple Mongo client connections you need to use the `grails.mongodb.connections` setting. For example in `application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
grails:
    mongodb:
        url: mongodb://localhost/books
        connections:
            moreBooks:
                url: mongodb://localhost/moreBooks
            evenMoreBooks:
                url: mongodb://localhost/moreBooks
----

You can configure individual settings for each Mongo client. If a setting is not specified by default the setting is inherited from the default Mongo client.
