===== Purpose

Returns the MongoDB https://api.mongodb.com/java/current/org/bson/Document.html[Document] for an instance of a domain class

WARNING: Using the `Document` object directly is discouraged, because it's inefficient. It's better to use <<dynamicAttributes>>.

===== Examples

[source,groovy]
----
def b = Book.get(1)

println b.dbo
----

===== Description

The `dbo` property allows access to the underlying MongoDB https://api.mongodb.com/java/current/org/bson/Document.html[Document], which is a respresentation of the stored BSON document that can be manipulated in memory.
